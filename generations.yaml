    description: "The Renault Clio III represented a significant step up in size, quality, and refinement compared to its predecessors. Designed under Patrick Le Quément's direction, the third-generation Clio adopted a more mature and substantial appearance with a focus on improved perceived quality. Available in both three and five-door body styles, the Clio III was built on the Nissan B platform shared with the Nissan Micra. Its dimensions increased significantly, pushing it toward the upper end of the supermini segment and approaching the size of some small family cars. Engine options included gasoline units ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 liters and diesel engines, primarily the efficient 1.5 dCi in various power outputs between 65 and 106 horsepower. The performance-oriented Clio Renault Sport featured a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter engine producing 197 horsepower, later increased to 200 horsepower in the refreshed Clio RS 200 Cup, with both versions receiving widespread acclaim for their handling dynamics and performance. Interior quality was substantially improved with better materials and construction, while safety features were enhanced, earning the car a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating—one of the first superminis to achieve this score. A facelift in 2009 updated the styling with a more contemporary front end inspired by the Mégane III. The Clio III continued in production alongside its successor in some markets as the 'Clio Collection' until 2014. This generation marked a turning point for the Clio, elevating its status from a basic supermini to a more sophisticated and refined vehicle that could compete with premium offerings in its segment, though some criticized the increased weight and size as diluting some of the nimble character of earlier models."
